## Description

This game is **especially** build for one of my classmates

This game use ```java.awt.*``` & ```javax.swing.*``` for Windowmize UI

With **only** *3* functions as "Water Tree", "Feed Tree" and "Clean Tree"

### Water Tree

If you water the tree, the tree will grow 1 block length of root with %```$waterAmount```

It sounds ridiculous 😁

### Feed Tree

If you feed the tree, the tree will grow 5 blocks length of root with %```$feedAmount```

### Clean Tree

As feeding or watering the tree will "dirtying" the tree with %30

If "Clean" value >=8, the tree will die
